# GIC-FAFNet

**GIC-FAFNet: Global-Local Information Coordination and Feature Alignment Fusion Network for Remote Sensing Object Detection**

This repository contains the implementation of **GIC-FAFNet**, built upon the [ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) framework for remote sensing object detection.  
In this work, we propose a network that combines global-local information coordination and feature alignment fusion to enhance detection performance in remote sensing imagery.
